# Phynteny

## Phynteny: Synteny-based annotation of viral genes 

## Usage 

## Training Phynteny 
Phynteny has already been trained for you on a dataset containing over 1 million prophages! However, If you feel inclined to train Phynteny yourself (maybe you live in the future and we have now discovered millions of phage genomes), the required scripts are available at: TODO 

**WARNING** Without a GPU training will take a very very long time! 

## Bugs and Suggestions 
If you break Phynteny or would like to make any suggestions please open an issue or email me at susie.grigson@flinders.edu.au
