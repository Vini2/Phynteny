# Phynteny

## Phynteny: Synteny-based annotation of viral genes 

## Usage 

## Training Phynteny 
Phynteny has already been trained for you on a dataset containing over 1 million prophages! However, If you feel inclined to train Phynteny yourself you can. <br> 
Phynteny is trained using genbank files containing PHROG annotations such as those generated by [pharokka](https://github.com/gbouras13/pharokka). 

Use `-i` as a text file with the paths to the genbank files 

```
python generate_training_data.py -i genbank_files.txt -o training_dataset.pkl 
```



**WARNING** Without a GPU training will take a very very long time! 

## Bugs and Suggestions 
If you break Phynteny or would like to make any suggestions please open an issue or email me at susie.grigson@flinders.edu.au
